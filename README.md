# 🚀 AWS CI/CD Pipeline with Automated Deployment

> An end-to-end CI/CD pipeline integrating **GitHub**, **AWS CodePipeline**, **AWS CodeBuild**, and **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** to automate application deployment with build validation, monitoring, and real-time email alerts using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon SNS**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a production-style Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS.

Whenever code is pushed to the **main** branch, the pipeline automatically:

- Detects source code changes
- Builds and validates the application
- Deploys the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Monitors deployment failures
- Sends real-time email notifications if the pipeline fails

The project eliminates manual deployment steps while improving deployment speed, reliability, and monitoring.

# ✨ Features

## ✅ Automated CI/CD

- Automatically triggers on every push to the **main** branch.
- No manual deployment required.

---

## ✅ Build Validation

Before deployment, CodeBuild automatically:

- Installs dependencies
- Validates Python syntax
- Imports the application
- Stops deployment if validation fails

Example:

```bash
python -m py_compile application.py

python -c "from application import application"
```

---

## ✅ Automated Deployment

Elastic Beanstalk automatically:

- Creates EC2 instances
- Configures Gunicorn
- Configures Nginx
- Deploys the Flask application

No manual server configuration is required.

---

## ✅ Monitoring

Amazon CloudWatch continuously monitors:

- Pipeline execution
- Deployment status
- Failure metrics

---

## ✅ Real-Time Alerts

If deployment fails:

CloudWatch →

SNS →

Email Notification

Users receive deployment failure notifications within minutes.

---

# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## Step 1 — Create Elastic Beanstalk

- Create a Python environment
- Platform: Python 3.x
- Environment Type: Single Instance
- Instance Type: t2.micro (Free Tier)

---

## Step 2 — Create CodeBuild Project

Configure:

- Source: GitHub
- Buildspec: `buildspec.yml`

---

## Step 3 — Create CodePipeline

Stages:

```
GitHub
    ↓
CodeBuild
    ↓
Elastic Beanstalk
```

---

## Step 4 — Configure Monitoring

Create:

- CloudWatch Alarm
- SNS Topic
- Email Subscription

---

# 🧪 Testing

## Successful Deployment

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated application"
git push origin main
```

Pipeline automatically:

- Detects commit
- Builds application
- Deploys application

---

## Failure Scenario

Break the application intentionally:

```python
from flask import
```

Push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Result:

- Build fails
- CloudWatch Alarm triggers
- SNS Email Notification is sent

---

# 📈 Results

| Metric | Manual Process | Automated Pipeline |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|
| Deployment Time | ~30 Minutes | ~5 Minutes |
| Build Validation | Manual | Automatic |
| Deployment | Manual | Automatic |
| Failure Detection | Manual | < 2 Minutes |
| Notifications | None | Email Alerts |
